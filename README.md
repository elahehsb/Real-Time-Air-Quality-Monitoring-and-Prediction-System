# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Monitoring-and-Prediction-System

Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive real-time air quality monitoring and prediction system. The platform will leverage open-source tools, cloud technologies, and advanced computational methods to handle and process large-scale air quality data efficiently. Users will be able to visualize current air quality, historical trends, and predict future air quality levels.


System Architecture

Components:


Data Ingestion: Tools for acquiring real-time air quality data from multiple sources.

Distributed Computing Cluster: Set up with Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.

Machine Learning: Implement models for air quality prediction.

Data Storage: Use a time-series database such as InfluxDB.

Web Application: Frontend for data visualization and user interaction.

Deployment: Containerization using Docker and orchestration using Kubernetes.
